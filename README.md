# RandEXom
Framework for randoming stuff

Just add RandEXom.dll as reference in your project.
For now it only contain randomisation via default .Net

This Framework include:

1) Gacha (Pooling Picker)

Like a gacha box, you put items inside, and when you pull you get the random value

2) GachaBatched

Like previous gacha system, but batched the same item into one for memory performance, but the process is slower than the vanilla (Around 100 ms) 

3) Pong

The random number, where it is change pole in next random, between near minimum or maximum

4) Distance

Set a threshold how big the distance of your number value
