# RandEXom
Framework for randoming stuff

Just add RandEXom.dll as reference in your project.
For now it only contain randomisation via default .Net

This Framework include:

1) Gacha (Pooling Picker)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a gacha box, you put items inside, and when you pull you get the random value

2) GachaBatched

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like previous gacha system, but batched the same item into one for memory performance, but the process is slower than the vanilla (Around 100 ms) 

3) Pong

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The random number, where it is change pole in next random, between near minimum or maximum

4) Distance

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set a threshold how big the distance of your number value
